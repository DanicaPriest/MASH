# MASH
This is an online version of the fortune telling children's game MASH. Mash stands for Mansion Apartment Shack and House. The player is prompted for various options then their future is predicted. Players can restart the game or redo their future by clicking on the buttons provided.

This is the original project I did when I first started coding. An improved updated version can be found here: https://github.com/DanicaPriest/MASHUpdated <br> and the app can be found here:https://mash-future-telling-game.herokuapp.com/
